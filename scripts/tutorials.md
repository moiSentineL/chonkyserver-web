## In-Game Economy

The game has a built-in economy (money money money).
You can earn money, give money, sell and buy stuff (ShopGUI) and become the richest in the server.

Players start out with a 150Ɖ (Dogecoins, for obvious reasons). And they get 20Ɖ as they level upto level 5, 10, 15 and 60Ɖ as they level upto level 20, 25, 30.

You can Sell and Buy stuff in the ShopGUI. And you can do so much more.

You can see your balance by using the command /bal and to find who's the richest, use /baltop.

## Plugin Tutorials 

### Better RTP 

Better RTP is a plugin that teleports you randomly to a place. This might be useful to get away from the base, to find more loot, and many more possibilities.
Remember that it costs 50Ɖ (ingame currency) for a RTP in the overworld, 250Ɖ in the Nether and 100Ɖ in The End.

Here is the command for the Random Teleport,

/rtp: Teleport Randomly.
/rtp world <worldname>: Teleport to another world. (Use worldname `world_nether` for Nether and `world_the_end` for The End)

Check this video out for more reference. Some of commands displayed in the video may be disabled in the server due to fairplay.

### UltimateClaims 

UltimateClaims is a plugin in the server that helps you to claim your land to protect it from hostile mob spawning, other players, and much more.

The plugin requires you to use something called a 'PowerCell' to manage your claim. The powercell requires fuel to keep working.
Here our fuels are, Iron Ingot, Diamond and Emerald. 
An Iron Ingots provides claim for 2 hours, Diamonds for 6 hours, and emeralds for 9 hours.

Ofcourse, this means you have to keep fueling the powercell in order to keep your claim from getting dissolved.

You can use the command /c for more help.

Or you can check this video out for more information. Remember, some commands might be disabled.
